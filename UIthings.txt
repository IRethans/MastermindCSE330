1. click on a colored ball. It blurs out on the location where it was. Then if you click on the location where you want it,
the ball is placed at that location and the blurred ball dissapears.
2. If you click on a ball in your guessing code, it moves back to its original place (with a little animation)
3. If you insert the last ball in the row, it immediately checks per ball: 
	- Is this color in the correct place 
		- Yes? --> A small black ball appears to the right of the guessed code
		- No? --> Check the next question
	- Is this color in the code
		- Yes? --> A small white ball appears to the right of the guessed code
		- No? --> Nothing appears
3. If you click on the sound button, a no-sound button appears on its place and the sound is muted
4. If you click on the information button, a pop-up instruction window appears.
5. After a game is finished show the player if they won or lost and have two buttons: one for play again and another for quit.
	
We are using the basic constructor for all of the game objects.
This is for us the more easy way to implement everything as we have no prior experience.


The messages that need to be sent between the server and the clients:
There are two players; start the game.
The guess of the player gets sent to the server to check.
The server sends the almost correct and correct values to BOTH players.
The players can continue.
